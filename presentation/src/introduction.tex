\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Context}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The need for always faster data processing devices is ever increasing
		\item This motivates the study of a new physical computation paradigm, the \alert{optical computer}
		\item This kind of computer relies on light to process information
		\item Different ways to implement computing logic
		\item In this work, focus on \textbf{Reservoir Computing} (RC)
	\end{itemize}
