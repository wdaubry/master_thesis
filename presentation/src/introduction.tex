\begin{frame}{Introduction}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The development of next generation technological computation paradigm is investigated
		\item Optical computers use light as information carrier $\longrightarrow$ \textit{fast}
		\item Optical computers do not need to rely on boolean logic as classical computers do, new computation paradigms based on specific physical properties of light can be implemented
		\item \textit{Photonic reservoir computing} is one of such implementation
	\end{itemize}
