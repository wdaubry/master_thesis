abstract = {We present a method for learning nonlinear systems, echo state networks (ESNs). ESNs employ artificial recurrent neural networks in a way that has recently been proposed independently as a learning mechanism in biological brains. The learning method is computationally efficient and easy to use. On a benchmark task of predicting a chaotic time series, accuracy is improved by a factor of 2400 over previous techniques. The potential for engineering applications is illustrated by equalizing a communication channel, where the signal error rate is improved by two orders of magnitude.},

@article{AkroutAkram2016Pprc,
abstract = {Today's unrelenting increase in demand for information processing creates the need for novel computing concepts. Reservoir computing is such a concept that lends itself particularly well to photonic hardware implementations. Over recent years, these hardware implementations have gained maturity and now achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark tasks. However, implementations so far are essentially all based on sequential data processing, leaving the inherent parallelism of photonics unexploited. Parallel implementations process all neurons simultaneously, and therefore have the potential of reducing computation time by a factor equal to the number of neurons, compared to sequential architectures. Here, we report a parallel reservoir computer that uses frequency domain multiplexing of neuron states. We illustrate its performance on standard benchmark tasks such as nonlinear channel equalization, the reproduction of a nonlinear 10th-order system, and speech recognition, obtaining error rates similar to previous optical experiments. The present experiment is thus an important step towards high speed, low footprint, all optical photonic information processing.},

abstract = {Reservoir Computing is a bio-inspired computing paradigm for processing time dependent signals. The performance of its analogue implementation are comparable to other state of the art algorithms for tasks such as speech recognition or chaotic time series prediction, but these are often constrained by the offline training methods commonly employed. Here we investigated the online learning approach by training an opto-electronic reservoir computer using a simple gradient descent algorithm, programmed on an FPGA chip. Our system was applied to wireless communications, a quickly growing domain with an increasing demand for fast analogue devices to equalise the nonlinear distorted channels. We report error rates up to two orders of magnitude lower than previous implementations on this task. We show that our system is particularly well-suited for realistic channel equalisation by testing it on a drifting and a switching channels and obtaining good performances},
